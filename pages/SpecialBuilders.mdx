# Special Builder Expressions

There are a couple special builder computation expressions to take note of. These builder expressions follow the Solid-JS reference, but are documented due to F# quirks.

## For, Index

As per the Solid-JS implementation, the `For` and `Index` tags receive an anonymous function as children.

Due to computation expressions not automatically yielding anonymous functions, ensure that you yield the function. You'll know things are working when you get your inline type hints.

```fsharp
[<SolidComponent>]
let ForExample () =
    For(each = [| "button1"; "button2" |]) {
        yield fun item index ->
            button() { item }
    }
```
<ForExample></ForExample>

# Custom Builders

> Note: Common builders are pre-implemented for you to interface with. See Builder Interfaces

There are cases where you may need to implement your own builder expression for a type component. This can often occur when binding certain libraries.

Let's take an example: Implementing the ArkUI DatePicker:

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.ArkUI
open Partas.Solid
open Fable.Core

[<Import("DatePicker.Context","IMPORT_MODULE")>]
type DatePickerContext() =
    inherit RegularNode()
```

The ArkUI DatePickerContext element takes an anonymous function as a child which has one argument, the context object.

In this example, we take a special approach of implementing the builder as a typed interface, as we assume that there are other ArkUI components that will use contexts in a similar manner. We therefore will define our interface type that will contain the builder:

```fsharp
[<Interface; Erase>]
type ArkUIContext<'T> =
    inherit HtmlContainer
    inherit HtmlElement
```

We can then define the builder as an extension of this type

```fsharp "HtmlContainerFun"
[<AutoOpen>]
module Bindings =
    type ArkUIContext<'T> with
        [<Erase>]
        member inline _.Yield(
            PARTAS_VALUE: Accessor<'T> -> #HtmlElement
        ): HtmlContainerFun =
            fun PARTAS_CONT -> ignore PARTAS_VALUE
```

The type definition for `HtmlContainerFun` is defined in the `Partas.Solid` library in `Builder.fs`.

```fsharp title="Builder.fs"
type HtmlContainerFun = HtmlContainer -> unit
```

---

It is important when defining our binding to use special names such as PARTAS_VALUE or PARTAS_CONT for identifiers where possible, as they are already being picked up by the plugin, or are easily identifiable.

Look at `Builder.fs` in `Partas.Solid` to see what other builder names are in use.

---

Returning to our example with the DatePicker tag, we can now interface with our new builder helper using any object that will be passed within our anonymous function.

```fsharp
type DatePickerApi = Glutinum.ZagJs.DatePickerApi
[<Import("DatePicker.Context", datePicker)>]
type DatePickerContext() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    interface ArkUIContext<DatePickerApi>
```

```fsharp title="Example Usage"
DatePickerContext() {
    yield fun ctx ->
        // ...
}
```

The `ctx` argument is now correctly typed as `Accessor<DatePickerApi>`!

---

## Gotchas

As mentioned previously, it is important to use names for identifiers that are picked up by the Plugin.

When using `[<Import(_, _)>]` on a type that contains the builder expression, the identifiers are eliminated in the AST.

The PARTAS_CONT identifier in the lambdas of the builder Yield expressions has special meaning when being transformed by the plugin. It results in the function being uncurried.

### PartasImport

To remedy this, there is `[<PartasImport(_, _)>]` which is a reimplementation of the `Import` attribute. It functions the exact same, but our plugin injects the import instead of Fable.

In this manner, we are able to produce an AST that has special identifier names when adding computation expressions to a type which is imported from a library.

## Builder Keywords

[//]: # TO FINISH ()
Using these keywords in builders will cause transformations when they are read by the plugin. These transforms are usually in the realm of unwrapping lambdas and disposing
noops, but can also include special pattern matches like transforming curried functions in the case of PARTAS_CONT

- PARTAS_THIS
- PARTAS_RUNEXPR
- PARTAS_YIELD
- PARTAS_ELEMENT
- PARTAS_TEXT
- PARTAS_CONT
- PARTAS_DELAY
- PARTAS_FIRST
- PARTAS_SECOND
- PARTAS_BUILDER
