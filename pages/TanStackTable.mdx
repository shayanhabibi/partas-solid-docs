# Partas.Solid.TanStack.Table

# TanStack-Tables Bindings

See [the docs](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/introduction) for usage. Make sure to select the `Solid` framework when viewing the docs.

## Differences

This is a massive library, so there a few more caveats/discrepancies in usage to keep in mind:

1. All options should be done using the provided Pojo Constructors

```fsharp title="Example of TanStack.Table ColumnDefs with provided Pojo Constructors"
[<SolidComponent>] // <-- We apply the attribute so we're in a plugin scope
let idColumn = ColumnDef<Patient>(
    id = "id"
    ,accessorFn = fun patient _ -> patient.Id
    ,enableSorting = false // v---- type is inferred by the compiler
    ,cell = fun (props: CellRenderProps<Patient>) ->
        span(class' = "text-xs text-muted-foreground justify-items-start") {
            props.cell.getValue() |> unbox<string>
        }
    ,header = fun props ->
        div(class' = "text-lg") { "Id" }
)
```

2. Use method extensions to set `getter` object fields of options

The `TableOptions` is a perfect example of an options which requires the use of extension methods to set fields which are required to be
`getters` to be reactive in solid-js.

The main fields that require this are:
- data
- columns
- state accessors

```fsharp
TableOptions<'Data>(
    getCoreRowModel = getCoreRowModel()
    ,getFacetedRowModel = getFacetedRowModel() //v--- Signal
    ,onRowSelectionChanged = unbox(snd rowSelection)
)   .data(fun _ -> dataSource.data)
    .columns(fun _ -> columnDefs)
    .stateFn(fun (state: TableState) ->//v--- Signal
        state.rowSelection(fst rowSelection)
            .sorting(fst sorting)
            .pagination(fst pagination)
    )
```

> Use `.init()` helpers for State Signals

```fsharp
let rowSelection = RowSelectionState.init() |> createSignal
```

---

There's actually not much else that's too different from the source guides/examples. There does have to be some work done on the typings, but a lot of the issues that existed binding
this library in the first place have mostly been ironed out.
