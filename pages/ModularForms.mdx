# Partas.Solid.ModularForms

## ModularForms Binding

See [the docs](https://modularforms.dev/solid/api/createForm) to learn about the API and components.

Other than a couple caveats to do with Fable.Remoting and some helpers for typing, it's been quite simple to use the library in its current state.

## Differences

You can use "name" to ascribe the mapping to a field for a form as per the docs, but I've added a useful method extension in these scenarios: `map`. Just as you expect,
it takes a lambda function that maps to the field from the form and converts it under the hood with `Fable.Core.Experimental.namesofLambda` into a string path.

So let's say you have a form of type:

```fsharp
type FormData = {
    Item: string
    Id: int
    Value: float
}
```

You would connect a field to this form via a `Field` component (as per the source), but instead of using `Field(name = "Value")`, you can use `map` to also provide the type parameters to the
field props.

```fsharp
let form = createFormStore<FormData,obj>()
let valueField = Field(of' = form).map(_.Value) { 
        yield fun field (* FieldStore<FormData, float> *) fieldProps (* FieldElementProps *) ->
            // ...
    }
```

## Fable.Remoting - Considerations

This library works great with Fable.Remoting, with a couple caveats to keep in mind.

### Invalid Submissions

If you are using records to structure your form data, then you must ensure that all fields of the record are initialised by passing an initialValue.

ModularForms will not send null data (to save transmission size), while Fable.Remoting will not match an object to a record without all fields and types matching.

This ALSO means that you will have to have a `Field` component set for each field of the record (although they do not have to be visible or active) so that the field is provided a value for each submission.

## Reset/Prefill Form/Fields

The best thing to do when trying to reset/set the form to a certain state, is to use `reset(form, initialValue = (* ... *))`. Even when resetting to a cleared state, the best idea is to pass an empty/default form value.
