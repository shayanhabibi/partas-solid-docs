# Polymorphism

There are libraries such as Kobalte and ArkUI which allow polymorphism. This is where the properties of the parent are passed to the specified component or tag.

In Kobalte, this is via the `as` attribute.

```jsx
<Button as={a} href={"/"} />
```

Partas.Solid provides plugin support for Polymorphism for Kobalte, and methodology for you to enable polymorphism in other libraries.

## Plugin Support

Any element which provides a polymorphic interface must interface with the specified type:

```fsharp "Partas.Solid.Polymorphism" "interface Polymorph"
namespace Partas.Solid.PolymorphicComponent
open Partas.Solid
open Fable.Core

[<Erase>]
type PolymorphicComponent() =
    interface RegularNode
    interface Polymorph // interface specified type
    // ...
```

### Polymorphic attribute

The polymorphic attribute `as` is supported by default in the plugin (to interop with Kobalte), so you can define this attribute without any special treatment.

```fsharp title="Polymorphism by tag value"
[<Erase>]
type PolymorphicComponent() =
    interface RegularNode
    interface Polymorph // interface specified type
    [<Erase>]
    member val as': TagValue = JS.undefined with get,set
    // ...
```

This attribute is treated special, and you lost a lot of the special plugin behaviour if you use polymorphism via values (in F# at least).

The reason for this is that polymorphism will often result in you utilising the morphed components properties in usage. Since we cannot dynamically inherit properties in F#, we instead support polymorphism by passing the whole HtmlElement to the attribute.

```fsharp title="Dual polymorphism support"
[<Erase>]
type PolymorphicComponent() =
    interface RegularNode
    interface Polymorph // interface specified type
    [<Erase>]
    member val as': TagValue = JS.undefined with get,set
    // ...

[<System.Extension; Erase>]
module PolymorphicExtension =
    type PolymorphicComponent with
        [<Erase; Extension>]
        member _.as'
            [<Erase>]
            with set(value: HtmlElement) = ()
            [<Erase>]
            and get(): HtmlElement = JS.undefined
```

The above implementation style allows us to use both a tag value, or a built element.

The plugin will extract all the properties from the component passed to `as'` and insert them into the parent.

## Custom Polymorphic Attributes

In the case where you need an attribute to support the above type of *property raising*, you can make use of a special magic prefix.

```fsharp title="Custom Polymorphic attributes" "__PARTAS_POLYMORPHIC__"
[<Erase>]
type PolymorphicComponent() =
    interface RegularNode
    interface Polymorph // interface specified type
    [<Erase>]
    member val ``__PARTAS_POLYMORPHIC__asChild``: HtmlElement = JS.undefined with get,set
    member this.asChild
        [<Erase>]
        with inline set(value: HtmlElement) = this.``__PARTAS_POLYMORPHIC__asChild`` <- value
        [<Erase>]
        and inline get() = this.``__PARTAS_POLYMORPHIC__asChild``
    // ...
```

The compiler plugin will cleave the prefix from the attribute name, convert the HtmlElement passed into a tag value, and raise all properties from the HtmlElement into the parent.

# Attr Extension

Of course, you can skip all of the above and just pass a tagvalue to the libraries polymorphic attribute, and then chain `.attr`s for the attributes that the parent does not have. But this would miss all the compiler type safety features of F# and Fable that we are trying to take advantage of in the first place.
