# Common Issues

The most frequent issues that I run into are:
1. Forgetting to use a namespace that starts with Partas.Solid
    - The original motivation for this was to prevent over zealous transformations
2. Forgetting to `yield` an anonymous function in a computation

```fsharp "yield"
For(each = [| "1"; "2" |]) {
    yield fun item index -> // ...
}
```

3. Forgetting to turn off typedArrays
