# Partas.Solid.Cmdk

## Cmdk-Solid Bindings

See [the docs](https://cmdk-solid.vercel.app/) for usage.

## Differences

While the `useCommandState` function is bound, it does not have a typed return value at this time.

## Example

Implementation can be found in [Partas.Solid.UI](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.UI)
