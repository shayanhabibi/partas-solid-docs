# Installation

## Fable 5

Ensure you have Fable 5.0+ installed.

```ansi
// Create your dotnet tool manifest in a new solution
[38;5;81mdotnet new tool-manifest

[0m// Install fable to solution
[38;5;81mdotnet tool install Fable
```

> At the time of writing, Fable 5 is still in *alpha* (although it is absolutely usable, it is understandable if this is a dealbreaker until a stable release), to install it, you might need to pass the `--prerelease` flag.

## Partas.Solid

With Dotnet:

```ansi
[38;5;81mdotnet add package Partas.Solid
```

With Paket:

```ansi
[38;5;81mpaket install Partas.Solid
```

## NPM

This gives you everything you need to start (ie you can compile with fable and see the output JSX).

But if you want to build and view components etc, then you'll need to setup
vite or whatever other builder you want.

You'll then also want to install the NPM dependencies for Solid-js.

```ansi
[38;5;2mnpm install solid-js
```

## Bindings

### Femto

When installing or using the bindings I've crafted, you can use femto to also manage the NPM dependencies. However, for some libraries this might not be possible (as they may have components packaged in versioned libraries themselves).
