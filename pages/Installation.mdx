# Installation

## Fable 5

Ensure you have Fable 5.0+ installed.

```ansi
// Create your dotnet tool manifest in a new solution
[38;5;81mdotnet new tool-manifest

[0m// Install fable to solution
[38;5;81mdotnet tool install Fable
```

> At the time of writing, Fable 5 is still in *alpha*, to install it, you might need to pass the `--prerelease` flag.

## Partas.Solid

With Dotnet:

```ansi
[38;5;81mdotnet add package Partas.Solid
```

With Paket:

```ansi
[38;5;81mpaket install Partas.Solid
```

## NPM

This gives you everything you need to start (ie you can compile with fable and see the output JSX).

But if you want to build and view components etc, then you'll need to setup
vite or whatever other builder you want.

You'll then also want to install the NPM dependencies for Solid-js.

```ansi
[38;5;2mnpm install solid-js
```

### Solid.Bindings

There are a suite of bindings for Solid-js [libraries](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.Bindings/) and [primitives](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.Primitives/) that I have compiled into mono-repos. The stability of their APIs depends on the extent of their uses in my own code.

### Partas.Solid.UI

A [component library](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.UI/) I built using Partas.Solid which is a port of `solid-ui` (which itself is a port of `shadcn-ui` and others) along with some other components and effects.
