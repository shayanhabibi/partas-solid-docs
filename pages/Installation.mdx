# Installation

## Fable 5

Ensure you have Fable 5.0+ installed.

```
// Create your dotnet tool manifest in a new solution
dotnet new tool-manifest

// Install fable to solution
dotnet tool install Fable
```

> At the time of writing, Fable 5 is still in *alpha*, to install it, you might need to pass the `--prerelease` flag.

## Partas.Solid

With Dotnet:

```
dotnet add package Partas.Solid
```

With Paket:

```
paket install Partas.Solid
```

## NPM

This gives you everything you need to start (ie you can compile with fable and see the output JSX).

But if you want to build and view components etc, then you'll need to setup
vite or whatever other builder you want.

You'll then also want to install the NPM dependencies for Solid-js.

```
npm install solid-js
```
