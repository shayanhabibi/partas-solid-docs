# Installation

## Fable 5

Ensure you have Fable 5.0+ installed.

```ansi
// Create your dotnet tool manifest in a new solution
[38;5;81mdotnet new tool-manifest

[0m// Install fable to solution
[38;5;81mdotnet tool install Fable
```

> At the time of writing, Fable 5 is still in *alpha* (although it is absolutely usable, it is understandable if this is a dealbreaker until a stable release), to install it, you might need to pass the `--prerelease` flag.

## Partas.Solid

With Dotnet:

```ansi
[38;5;81mdotnet add package Partas.Solid
```

With Paket:

```ansi
[38;5;81mpaket install Partas.Solid
```

## NPM

This gives you everything you need to start (ie you can compile with fable and see the output JSX).

But if you want to build and view components etc, then you'll need to setup
vite or whatever other builder you want.

You'll then also want to install the NPM dependencies for Solid-js.

```ansi
[38;5;2mnpm install solid-js
```

## Bindings

### Femto

When installing or using the bindings I've crafted, you can use femto to also manage the NPM dependencies. However, for some libraries this might not be possible (as they may have components packaged in versioned libraries themselves).

# Compiling/Usage

Compile with the following flags passed to fable:

```ansi caption="typedArrays optional, see below"
[38;5;81m-e .fs.jsx -c Release [0m[--typedArrays false]
```

---

## JSX

This plugin compiles to JSX. You will need to therefore tell Fable to compile your JS files with the `.jsx` extension.

```ansi
[38;5;81m-e .fs.jsx
```

---

## Release vs Debug AST

F# & Fable give different AST trees between Release and Debug mode. The plugin was developed with Release mode in mind.
This is a non-issue until you try to compile with `fable watch`.

> When compiling with <c>fable watch</c> or in debug mode, use the release flag

```ansi
[38;5;81m-c Release
```

---

## Typed arrays

Fable uses the most optimised/performant primitives when compiling to `js` (ie not `ts`). This means integer arrays are
compiled into the Int32Array primitives in `js`.

This becomes an issue when you're passing arrays of integers to libraries like `ApexCharts`.

There are two solutions to the problem, you can either disable typed arrays using a fable flag:

```ansi
[38;5;81m--typedArrays false
```

Or, you can `cast` the integers into a different type:

```fsharp

// VALID:
let data = [|
    box 4
    box 18
    box 43
|]

```
