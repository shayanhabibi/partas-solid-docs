# Installation

## Fable 5

Ensure you have Fable 5.0+ installed.

```ansi
// Create your dotnet tool manifest in a new solution
[38;5;81mdotnet new tool-manifest

[0m// Install fable to solution
[38;5;81mdotnet tool install Fable
```

> At the time of writing, Fable 5 is still in *alpha*, to install it, you might need to pass the `--prerelease` flag.

## Partas.Solid

With Dotnet:

```ansi
[38;5;81mdotnet add package Partas.Solid
```

With Paket:

```ansi
[38;5;81mpaket install Partas.Solid
```

## NPM

This gives you everything you need to start (ie you can compile with fable and see the output JSX).

But if you want to build and view components etc, then you'll need to setup
vite or whatever other builder you want.

You'll then also want to install the NPM dependencies for Solid-js.

```ansi
[38;5;2mnpm install solid-js
```

### Solid.Bindings

There are a suite of bindings for popular libraries that I have created for Partas.Solid

They range in completion and stability of api. At the current moment, some have femto compatibility, and others not.

The wisest thing to do when using these libraries is to manually install the dependencies.
