# Solid-JS API Differences

## Methods with Option Objects

Where encountered, the standard `Partas.Solid` bindings embed _option objects_ into the method as optional parameters. These are then compiled into option objects by Fable using the `ParamObject` attribute.

These are quite benign, and can be discerned quickly from the type signatures. As an example, you can compare the following signature to the [Solid-js signature](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/secondary-primitives/create-deferred).

```fsharp
/// <summary>
/// Creates a readonly that only notifies downstream changes when the browser is idle. <c>timeoutMs</c> is the
/// maximum time to wait before forcing the update.
/// </summary>
[<ImportMember("solid-js"); ParamObject(1)>]
static member createDeferred<'T>(source: unit -> 'T, ?timeoutMs: int, ?equals: 'T -> 'T -> bool, ?name: string): unit -> 'T = jsNative
```

## Special JSX Attributes
_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#special-jsx-attributes), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

Note that `attr:`, `on:`, `bool:`, `ref` attributes are exposed as F# methods in the API: `elem.on(...)`, `elem.attr(...)` etc. Also, `style` and `class'` are attributes when accepting `string`, while `style'` and `classList` are methods when accepting object (to be used with createObj).

Note: when using `ref(nativeElem)` make sure that nativeElem is mutable (e.g. `let mutable nativeElem = Unchecked.defaultof<HTMLDivElement>`).


## Store

_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#store), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

Similar to the original implementation in `Fable.Solid`, store has a special helper for updating its fields:

```fsharp
setStore // store setter
    .Path // special property to access store fields
    .Map(_.data) // choose which field to update
    .Update(newData) // update field with a new value
```

## Resource

_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#resource), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

Again, just as in the original implementation in `Fable.Solid`, resource is a special object, so instead of JS `resource()` call, you'll need to use `resource.current` in F#.

## Router

_This section is mostly [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#router), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

[Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router) namespace is `Partas.Solid.Router`. It contains router related components and functions. To render a router you still need to decorate router function with `SolidComponent` attribute:

```fsharp
open Partas.Solid.Router

[<SolidComponent>]
let MyRouter () =
    Router() {
        Route(path = "/", component'=!!Home)
        Route(path="/about", component'=!!About)
    }

render (MyRouter, document.getElementById "root")
```

_You still need to add a separate reference to @solidjs/router in your package.json._

## Aria

_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#aria), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

Similar to the original Oxpecker.ViewEngine additional Aria attributes reside in a separate module, so you need to write `open Oxpecker.Solid.Aria` to access them.

## SVG

_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#svg), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

Partas supports SVG elements, so you can use them in your components as well. Just make sure to add `open Partas.Solid.Svg` to make it work.

## Lazy

_This section is [copied directly from Oxpecker.Solid](https://lanayx.github.io/Oxpecker/src/Oxpecker.Solid/#lazy), all credit goes to [Lanayx](https://github.com/Lanayx)_

For components lazy loading youâ€™ll need to use lazy' function together with another importComponent function.

```fsharp
lazy'(fun () -> importComponent("./ComponentA"))
```

will be translated to

```fsharp
lazy(() => import("./ComponentA"))
```

## Signal Setters

When creating a signal (getter/setter tuple), the F# type signature for the getter and setter are as follows:

```fsharp
type Accessor<'T> = unit -> 'T
type Setter<'T> = 'T -> unit
```

Setters in Solid-JS can alternatively use their previous value as a reference when setting a new value. In Oxpecker and Partas, this is done by using the special `Invoke` methods:

```fsharp
let getter,setter = createSignal 0
setter.Invoke(fun previous -> previous + 1)
console.log (getter()) // 1
```

Setters in Solid-JS return the value they have been set to which is usually discarded in usage. If you require the value, you can use the special `InvokeAndGet` methods.

## Context Providers

> Context objects allow deeply nested children to access values without property passing

Context providers work as expected. Create a context, and then use it as a tag. It will be rendered with the `.Provider` suffix.

```fsharp
let context = createContext<int>() // define value type, can be anything!
[<SolidComponent>]
let ContextUsage () =
    context(5) { ... } // Provide initial value to context provider
```

```jsx title="Render of context(5)"
<context.Provider value={5}>
    ...
</context.Provider>
```

The `useContext` function does not differ in usage to Solid-JS.
