# Builder Interfaces

When creating bindings, or perhaps when making a specialised component, you may find yourself
needing an interface which allows custom types or properties to be passed to your children (much like
the Solid-js Index and For components).

In these cases, you can make use of some of the predefined builder interfaces.

```fsharp
// Taking an example from the Special Builders page
type DatePickerApi = Glutinum.ZagJs.DatePickerApi
[<Import("DatePicker.Context", datePickerPath)>]
type DatePickerContext() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    interface ChildLambdaProvider<Accessor<DatePickerApi>>
```

```fsharp title="Example Usage"
DatePickerContext() {
    yield fun ctx -> // ctx is typed as Accessor<DatePickerApi>
        // ...
}
```

There are two flavours of builder interfaces to interface with, and each define interfaces
with up to 4 parameters to use:

## Strict Interfaces

These interfaces have the suffix Strict, and provide you the capacity to define the
base type of the children that are accepted. This can allow you to define a component which
only accepts certain other components as children.

```fsharp
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict<'Param1, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict2<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict3<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict4<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Param4, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
```

## Standard Interfaces

These interfaces will accept any type that interfaces or inherits HtmlElement.

```fsharp
type ChildLambdaProvider<'Param1> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider2<'Param1, 'Param2> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider3<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider4<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Param4> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
```
