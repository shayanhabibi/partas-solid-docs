# Object Spreading

```fsharp title="Spreading Objects"
[<SolidComponent>]
let MyComponent () =
    let myObj = {| ``class`` = "bg-primary" |}
    div().spread myObj { "Primary BG" }
```

<SpreadExampleZero></SpreadExampleZero>

Any identifier can be spread within a tag using the special extension method `.spread`.

```fsharp title="Spreading Props"
// ...
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        props.class' <- "bg-accent"
        div().spread props { "Accent BG" } 
```

This is most commonly used in building complex components where the properties of a parent component are passed to a nested child component.

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.MyCenteredButton
open Fable.Core
open Partas.Solid

[<Erase>]
type MyCenteredButton() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        div(class' = "flex justify-center w-full") {
            button().spread props
        }
        
// usage
[<SolidComponent>]
let SpreadExampleOne () =
    MyCenteredButton(class' = "bg-primary hover:bg-background") { "Centered" }
```

## Gotchas

When used with `SolidTypeComponent`'s properties, one must remember that any reads from the `props` identifier before or after the spread will result in the plugin splitting that property from the identifier.

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.MyCenteredButton
open Fable.Core
open Partas.Solid

[<Erase>]
type MyCenteredButtonTwo() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
    div(class' = "flex justify-center w-full") {
        div(class' = props.class') { "Div" }
        button().spread props
    }

// usage
[<SolidComponent>]
let SpreadExampleTwo () =
    MyCenteredButtonTwo(class' = "bg-primary hover:bg-background") { "Centered" }
```

<SpreadExampleTwo></SpreadExampleTwo>

In the above example, the div receives the classes that we pass to `MyCenteredButtonTwo`, but the button does not receive it because it was removed from the `props` identifier when it was read by the div.

In cases like this, if you want to pass these split properties with the spread, you have to manually pass the properties to the child along with the spread:

```fsharp
[<Erase>]
type MyCenteredButtonThree() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        div(class' = "flex w-full justify-center") {
            div(class' = props.class') { "Div" }
            button(class' = props.class').spread props
        }
```
