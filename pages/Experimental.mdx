# Experimental Features

> Beware, all ye who tread here.

Please use these features cautiously. Some computation expressions are more tested than others in real world usage.

## Computation Expressions

Many methods in `Solid-js` use take lambdas without parameters as arguments to maintain reactivity such as `createEffect`.

For these, computation expressions are provided that abstract away the method call and empty function boiler plate. However, if you want to use the options or overloads available to one of the methods, then you'll need to call it directly instead of using a CE sugar.

To access these expressions, you must open the `Partas.Solid.Experimental` namespace.

### lambda

Wraps the computation in `fun () -> ...`

```fsharp
let config = lambda { Data.config.data }
// Same as
let config = fun () -> Data.config.data

console.log (config())
```

### effect

Wraps the computation in `createEffect(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
effect {
    console.log "I'm in an effect"
}
// Same as
createEffect(fun () ->
    console.log "I'm in an effect"
)
```

### mount

Wraps the computation in `onMount(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
mount {
    Data.Config.resource.refetch()
}
// Same as
onMount(fun () -> Data.Config.resource.refetch())
```

### cleanup

Wraps the computation in `onCleanup(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
cleanup {
    thishere.available <- false
}
// Same as
onCleanup(fun () -> thishere.available <- false)
```

### memo

Wraps the computation in `createMemo(fun() -> ...)`

```fsharp
memo {
    // ...
}
// Same as
createMemo(fun () -> ...)
```

### batch

Wraps the computation in `batch(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
let submissionResult = batch {
    // Some reactive tasks here
}
// Same as
let submissionResult = batch(fun () ->
    // Some reactive tasks here
)
```

### lazyload

Wraps the computation in `lazy'(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
let comp = lazyload { importComponent "./MyComponent.fs.jsx" }
// Same as
let comp = lazy'(fun () -> importComponent "./MyComponent.fs.jsx")
```
### selector

Wraps the computation in `createSelect(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
let isSelected = selector {
    // ...
}
// Same as
let isSelected = createSelect(fun () ->
    // ...
)
```

### children

Wraps the computation in `children(fun () -> ...)`

```fsharp
let childs = children {
    props.children
}
// Same as
let childs = children(fun () ->
    props.children
)
```

## Erased Union Implicit Casting

When making bindings, it is common to have a function accept multiple different value types. Ordinarily, you would have to use the additional `!^` operator to cast into these
bindings erased unions.

Within the Experimental namespace, you can open the `U` module, which reimplements the erased unions of fable with implicit casting into the union.

I find this most useful when creating bindings, because it's less noisy when using them.

> Make sure your access to `Partas.Solid.Experimental.U` comes AFTER `Fable.Core`.

```fsharp
open Fable.Core
open Fable.Core.JsInterop
open Partas.Solid.Experimental.U

[<Import("somefunction","somelibrary")>]
let numberOrString (value: U2<string, int>): obj = jsNative

// previously you would have:
numberOrString !^"Something"
numberOrString "Something" // Will cause an error
numberOrString !^3. // Will cause an error
// With the experimental casting you can do:
numberOrString "Something"
numberOrString 2
numberOrString 3. // Will cause an error
// Depending on your configuration, you may get compiler warnings for op_Implicit usage. This can
// then be resolved by explicitly using !^, but at least you won't be obstructed from using the function as expected
```
> Be aware that these implicit helpers do not work with arrays/lists without either explicitly typing the value as an accepted array/list type or
> by using the erase operator `!^`. In other words, the behaviour returns to normal for these cases, requiring explicit casting with !^.

```fsharp
let numberOrString (value: U2<int, int list>): obj = jsNative

numberOrString 5 // works
numberOrString [ 5; 6 ] // Error: Expected type U2<int, int list>, but got 'a list
numberOrString ([5;6] : int list) // works
numberOrString !^[ 5; 6 ] // works
numberOrString !^[ "5"; "6" ] // error as expected
```
