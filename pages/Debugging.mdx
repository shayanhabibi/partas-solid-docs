# Debugging & Reporting Issues

If something doesn't seem to be going right, please use the `DebugMode` flag in combination with the actual `jsx` output and report an issue so that it can be addressed.

```fsharp title="Using the DebugFlag"
[<SolidComponent(PartasCompileFlag.DebugMode)>]
// ...

[<SolidTypeComponent(PartasCompileFlag.DebugMode)>]
// ...
```

### DebugMode

The `DebugMode` flag will cause the AST of the component in question to be printed. This in combination with the input, and the actual `jsx` output will allow any issue to be addressed.
