## Solid-primitive Bindings

There are some scattered primitives that I've bound at the current time. They are fairly easy to create and add using [the docs](https://primitives.solidjs.community/) and can be quite helpful.

Nuget released packages are femto compatible. Use their docs on the website to see usage. If there are discrepancies in how they are used in F#, these are (usually) detailed in
the types/members XmlDocs.

The repo for these bindings can be found [here](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.Primitives).
