# Oxpecker

Oxpecker is a full stack framework for F#. The front end DSL uses Computation Expressions
to template the DOM. Oxpecker.Solid uses this DSL to compose native elements. I discovered Oxpecker.Solid
when I came to a cross-roads with a private project I was working on. 

### Starting out with Feliz

Building
an app with the SAFE stack, which uses Elmish, React and Vite for the front end in Feliz
style, I came to a point where I found it increasingly difficult to discern where things were happening in my DOM elements.
The list approach meant I was either making components too small or diving into
indent nesting-hell.

```fsharp title="Some of my early days Fable/Feliz code" caption="This is not bad, but it's such a small tedious example, and I already feel it's a bit obfuscated. Perhaps that's just me or my IDE theme"
let Default () =
    // ...
    Html.div [
        prop.className "flex flex-row gap-5 p-2"
        prop.children [
            for size,label in sizes do
                UI.Button [
                    size
                    if label = "Icon" then
                        props.children (Icon.Image []) 
                    else props.text label
                ]
            UI.Button [
                props.text "Disabled"
                props.disabled true
            ]
           // ...
        ]
    ]
```

It was just a bit difficult for me to get a good view of at a glance. Combined with very obvious performance issues
with fairly small SPAs (in regards to React), I was in for a bad ride -

<div class="text-sm text-muted-foreground p-8">
    Now before you go and grab your pitch forks, yes I am aware that there are many ways to optimise React apps. Yes it was probably
    because I'm a rookie React and JS developer. But that is exactly the point. Because I'm NOT a JS developer, nor do I ever intend
    to be. 
    
    Yes, I'm one of those people, and here I am, trying to preach to you about a plugin for a F# -> JS transpiler.
</div>

### Discovering Oxpecker

Around this point the wonderful [Amplifying F#](https://amplifyingfsharp.io/) group did a session with Vladimir Schur (the author of Oxpecker),
which is where I found out about Oxpecker.Solid!

This was the first time seeing an alternative DSL that was not list based and had (in my perspective) a more intuitive
DSL. It was not the first time I had seen Solid-js. But it came at the right time where I was seriously frustrated with
trying to understand how to prevent performance loss with massive re-renders.

<div class="px-8 text-muted-foreground">
*"It was a match made in heaven!"*
</div>

I absolutely loved working with the DSL. It so much more closely **resembled** the examples I was looking at on the internet
for how to make some components etc.

One thing I **loved** too, was the fact that the *compiled output was also ***readable****.

<div class="px-8 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    Probably a good time to mention I have historically NEVER wanted to touch web development, and preferred working closer
    to the metal or making GUI executables with QT and Nim. But the project I had in mind demanded me to change my ways.
</div>
<div class="text-muted-foreground text-md font-bold px-8">
Why does the transpiled output matter?
</div>

I was surprised it mattered to me. I didn't think I would/should/even could care. But since I am quite set on this
highway-to-hell (vis-a-vis making a web app without touching JS) I am quite dependent on examples and guides that
are written in JSX/TSX. 

Not only this, but a lot of bindings I was finding were quite antiquated. The demands for my project were particular,
so it was not uncommon to try making or updating a binding.

But **ANY** issue I would run into, would leave me scratching my head. It was pretty damn difficult to see if my code was
even close to being correct on the output. Also, since there are such black magics required to make React renders performant,
it was IMPOSSIBLE for ME to understand what the heck was going right and what was going wrong!

<div class="text-muted-foreground text-sm px-8">
    Maybe it's something I've picked up from working with Nim-lang. I was writing and working on concurrent and parallelised
    data structures. I would look at a lot of research, and try implementing data structures that interested me. Nim itself 
    compiles to C, C++ and JavaScript. And *ahem* let's just say I was not someone who experienced the nim-compiler to be
    *kind*. There was plenty of jank to be had, and there were occasions where the compiled code of nim had to be explored
    as a sanity check.
</div>

So what does the nice output do for me? Now when I hit a roadblock, I could search up issues and compare my code _or even contribute issues with examples_.

I don't need to do a series of prints or abstract tests to see if the code has transpiled correctly. I can see it clearly.
As a certified smooth brain, I can just look at all the examples online and copy pasta to make my spaghetti.

#### Component Libraries, Spreading, Contexts, and Forking Oxpecker

Oxpecker was the essential step to me shaking away any requirement to need to know JS. Now I can write everything in F#.

I don't need to learn JS or *JSX* (in a sense I did, but that's besides the point), I write my F#, and if there's a supposed
issue in javascript land, I can use the abundant internet resources with some source-code in-hand that doesn't look like my attempt at cleaning
the garage.

Except for one thing. I wanted to make a component library. And there was no level of using functions, static parameters, or
optional method parameters that would replace the following issue: it was impossible, just like in feliz, for me to write
a component, and then use the Oxpecker DSL with those components. The DSL was only designed for the native components.
You could also use it for imported library types. But if I wanted to make a Shadcn-like component library with a headless
component package? Nope.

Part of the issue of this for me goes back to 'resembling JSX' to make use of abundant JS front end resources. But it also
has to do with one of those things that just makes someone 'tick'. This was __SO CLOSE__ to being absolutely __PERFECT__ in my
view.

So I started to make some contributions. This was the first time working with FSharp or Fable AST. It was not easy for me
to wrap my head around.

<div class="text-muted-foreground text-sm px-8">
    I was having problem with indent hell of Feliz. Have you seen the kind of output you get when you print Fable AST
    to console? Lord have mercy upon my soul.
</div>

After a variety of bumbled attempts to make changes, I did come to a realisation that I COULD achieve my dreams above.

I needed to find some way to make it so that, like an imported library tag, you would defined the properties, but then
be able to write the component function while having access to the properties of the type, and have them somehow linked
together.

Obviously, this was a good case for a member method.

On my fork, I made the changes to test if I could achieve the hallowed outcome I so desperately sought. I did manage to make
some headway, and discussed this -and some other features I wanted- with Lanayx (author of Oxpecker.Solid). Lanayx liked
the enthusiasm, but felt that the expanded API surface this was creating (and if you compare the two plugins, you can see
this definitely expanded the plugin API/logic) was not the direction he wanted to go in. At least, not for the moment, not
while he planned on keeping active maintenance and support for Oxpecker.Solid.

He gave permission to proceed with a *harder* fork. I am always humbled
to receive advice and get Lanayx/Vladimir's opinions, and he continues to graciously answer my sometimes absurd questions.
I still continue to contribute to Oxpecker.Solid, and will continue doing so.

In the end, while the Plugin logic/API has shifted drastically, the underlying *bindings* are still pretty much the same.
There are very minor differences when it comes to bindings (the most significant being that I use property getters and setters
for HtmlElements/Components while Oxpecker just uses setters), so they're basically always ready to be ported. Additionally, if I
bind some additional features of the solid-js library that weren't there before, then I will contribute those changes to Oxpecker.

I'm always happy to make Oxpecker versions of any binding that I have made, and I certainly do check with
bindings I think Lanayx would be interested in. An example is the Oxpecker.Solid.MotionOne and Oxpecker.Solid.Primitives. 
Although the latter is yet to be ported.

<div class="text-muted-foreground text-sm px-8">
    While I am happy to iterate over alpha-ware bindings and make them available, I do not want to pull them under the
    Oxpecker umbrella until they have had at least SOME real world testing and usage. I make changes very quickly, and
    this will become more laborious if I'm trying to track changes and then test them for both plugins. Once I achieve a
    stable binding API, I finalise the Oxpecker binding. For me, this is a matter of respecting Vladimir Schur, and not
    providing crud.
</div>


Essentially, I spend egregious amounts of time bashing out bindings, and running them through the ringer, and happily will
contribute any of these bindings with improved public APIs while continuing to bash out other bindings or work on my own
project.

In saying all of this, I would be willing (as I discussed with Lanayx to begin with) at any time to come together and bring
the plugin logic under Oxpecker and his ownership.

At this current time though, I am really time constrained and trying to hammer out features to enable my own project quickly, so it's not the
worst thing that the plugins are currently forked, as I can apply my CPU threads (which is how I like to think
of my ADHD brain) to rapidly iterating over the plugin and growing the features without much ~~needed~~ oversight.
