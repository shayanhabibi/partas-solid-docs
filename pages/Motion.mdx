# Partas.Solid.Motion

This binding as it currently stands, binds the `solid-motionone` library, and also binds the `animate` function from `motion`.

## Solid-MotionOne Binding

See [the docs]() for usage.

### Differences

The Motion component specific properties provide two signatures, the original name such as `initial` which takes a Feliz style list
of props to provide type safety and completion for all CSS style props, or a `-JSX` suffixed name such as `initialJSX` which injects
the JSX language so you can write the value in JSX directly.

For the general css properties such as `animate` and `initial`, you use the `MotionStyle` qualifier to access the properties in Feliz style.

For `transition`, you use the `MotionTransition` qualifier, which will provide type safety by enforcing values to use the `AnimationOptions` pojo.

## Motion Binding

See [the docs]() for usage.

> Only the `animate` function is bound at the moment.


# Example Usage

```fsharp
[<Erase>]
type WordRotate() =
    inherit div()
    interface OptionKeys
    [<Erase>] member val words: string[] = unbox null with get,set
    [<Erase>] member val duration: int = unbox null with get,set
    [<SolidTypeComponentAttribute>]
    member props.constructor =
        props.duration <- 2500 // set a default duration if none is set
        let index,setIndex = createSignal(0)
        createEffect(
            fun () ->
                let interval = setInterval (fun () -> setIndex.Invoke(fun prevIndex -> (prevIndex + 1) % (props.words.Length))) props.duration
                onCleanup(fun () -> clearInterval(interval))
        )
        Presence(exitBeforeEnter = true) {
            Show(when' = !!(index() + 1), keyed = true) {
                Motion(
                    initial = [
                        MotionStyle.opacity 0
                        MotionStyle.y -50
                    ],
                    animate = [
                        MotionStyle.opacity 1
                        MotionStyle.y 0
                    ],
                    exit = [
                        MotionStyle.opacity 0
                        MotionStyle.y 50
                    ],
                    transition = [
                        MotionTransition.duration 0.25
                        MotionTransition.easing Easing.EaseOut
                    ]
                ).spread props {
                    props.words[index()]
                }
            }
        }
```

As a side note, remember that the `createEffect` and related functions which take void functions can use the Experimental
computation expressions:

```fsharp title="Normal"
createEffect(
    fun () ->
        let interval = 
            setInterval (fun () -> setIndex.Invoke(fun prevIndex -> (prevIndex + 1) % (props.words.Length))) props.duration
        onCleanup(fun () -> clearInterval(interval))
)
```

```fsharp title="open Partas.Solid.Experimental"
effect {
    let interval = setInterval (fun _ -> setIndex.Invoke(fun prevIndex -> (prevIndex + 1) % props.words.Length))) props.duration
    cleanup { clearInterval(interval) }
}
```

If fixed, you could also use the JSX suffixed properties and have JSX language injection in IntelliJ IDEs when using the Motion components:

```fsharp
Presence(exitBeforeEnter = true) {
    Show(when' = !!(index() + 1), keyed = true) {
        Motion(
            initialJSX = "{ opacity: 0, y: -50 }",
            animateJSX = "{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }",
            exitJSX = "{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }",
            transitionJSX = "{ duration: 0.25, easing: 'ease-out' }"
        ).spread props {
            props.words[index()]
        }
    }
}
```

You'll know if it's fixed because you'll receive injected IDE suggestions for most HTML properties that take string enums like `dir` on normal HTML Elements.
