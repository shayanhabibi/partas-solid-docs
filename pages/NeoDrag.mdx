## NeoDrag/solid Bindings

Several DnD libraries were looked at to be bound. This was by far the simplest to bind without going through tens of typescript definition files to find the shape of all the options/events etc.

This has not received as much extensive testing as I would hope (as  I haven't had any use for DnD so far).

See [the docs](https://www.neodrag.dev/docs/solid) for usage.
