# Setters

In Solid-JS, setters can be passed either a new value, or an anonymous function which updates the previous value.

To replicate this, setters in Partas.Solid are provided an extension method `Invoke` and `InvokeAndGet`.

These methods can be provided a handler for the previous value, instead of a new value.
