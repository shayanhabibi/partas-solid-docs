# Contributing

All contributions, from usage, issues, discussions, documentation, features, etc are appreciated!

## Docs

I'm too close to this project now to understand what needs to be explained further. I would appreciate a helping hand in crafting documentation pages or letting me know where you need help.

## Standard Library

All submissions are appreciated. If a submission is made, it will very likely be relevant to, and useful for `Oxpecker.Solid` also.

Contributors will be provided opportunity to contribute to `Oxpecker.Solid` themselves, otherwise it will be done by myself and credited to them.

## Plugin

The plugin is extensively documented to explain usage.

```ansi title="File Structure"
Partas.Solid.FablePlugin
|-- Types.fs
|-- Utils.fs
|-- Spec.fs
|__ Plugin.fs
```

### Types

Contains DUs, types, and functions relating to those types.

### Utils

Contains utilities that are frequently used to simplify pattern recognition such as:

```fsharp
let (|StartsWith|_|) (value: string) = function
    | (s: string) when s.StartsWith(value) -> Some()
    | _ -> None
```

These utilities should be based on primitives rather than structures defined in `Types.fs`.

The only reason it is compiled after `Types.fs` is to allow us to utilise `PluginContext` (which is defined in `Types.fs`) if required.

### Spec

Contains methods to render or modify specific AST nodes under the `Baked` module.

Contains helper patterns or utilities to recognize and filter different AST Nodes under their respective module names. 

These are things such as the PartasName active pattern in the Ident module, which will only match against declared types that start with `Partas.Solid`, and then sanitize the type name and provide it as the matched value. 

### Plugin

The meat of the package.

Contains all the transformation logic and attributes.

Great effort is taken to document every pattern usage, what it aims to do, and why.
