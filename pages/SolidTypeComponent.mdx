# SolidTypeComponent

SolidTypeComponent attribute allows you to define a component implementation for a custom tag type.

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.MyComponent
open Partas.Solid
open Fable.Core

[<Erase>]
type CustomTag() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    [<Erase>] member val customAttribute: string = JS.undefined with get,set
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        div()
```

There are 3 requirements for a `SolidTypeComponent` to be valid:
1. Type is defined within a namespace that starts with `Partas.Solid`
2. The instance identifier must be named `props`
3. The member must have no arguments or parameters otherwise

### Accessing properties

Within the component implementation, you can access the passed properties via the `props` self-identifier.

## Properties Magics and Gotchas

### Property Defaults

Defining the default of a property within an implementation simply requires you to assign a value to the property via the `props`-self identifier.

This can be done at any point of the implementation, but is limited (naturally) to there being no more than one default for a particular property.

Using the previous example:

```fsharp
[<SolidTypeComponent>]
member props.constructor =
    props.customAttribute <- "default value" // Setting default value
    div() {
        props.customAttribute // Accessing attributes
    }
```

### SplitProps, MergeProps

Assigning default property values uses Solid-js mergeProps primitive to maintain reactivity. All assignments are collected and compiled into the top position of the implementation with `mergeProps`.

On the flip-side, accessing any property uses Solid-js splitProps primitive.

> This is done so that if and/or when you decide to `spread` the props identifier, you do not have to be concerned with splitting props to maintain reactivity

All property accesses are collected and compiled after the `mergeProps` of the implementation using `splitProps`.

This identifies **THE FIRST GOTCHA**:

> If at any point you want to spread the `props` identifier, be aware that any property accesses you have performed will exclude them from the spread.
>
> This is preferred usually.
>
> However, in the case where you want all `props` to be passed (including ones you have already accessed elsewhere) you will have to manually pass those properties to the child element.
