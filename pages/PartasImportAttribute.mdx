> If you need to bind a component which provides a state object to its children via a lambda, then you should use of the [`ChildLambdaProvider` interfaces](/interfaces) instead of writing computation expression methods.

When the `ImportAttribute` is used, the parameter/argument names of methods become generic in the subsequent AST.

The names of the parameters are specific in the case of the Builders that are used in constructing the computation expressions. This is done to simplify the transformation process.
When they are defined with the type declaration with a `ImportAttribute` (such as the `For` or `Index` elements), then the parameter names become obfuscated.

To prevent this, `PartasImportAttribute` is used. It performs the same job as `ImportAttribute`, but does so *after the fact*. This means the AST we parse is not obfuscated.
