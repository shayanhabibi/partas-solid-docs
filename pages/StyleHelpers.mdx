# Style Attribute Helpers

When using the `.style'` method which accepts an object, standard usage would be to construct an object using `createObj` or an anonymous record.

Alternatively, you can directly provide a list of key,value pairs in Feliz style. You can access helpers via `open Partas.Solid.Style` which provides named access to all CSS properties.

You also have access to enums for the CSS properties via the above accessed module. This works best when used in conjunction with the Experimental Erased Unions. Please see the relevant section in the [Experimental](/experimental) page
