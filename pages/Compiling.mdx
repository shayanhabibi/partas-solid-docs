# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm preparing for release, the docs are under renovation.

# Compiling

## JSX

This plugin compiles to JSX. You will need to therefore tell Fable to compile your JS files with the `.jsx` extension.

```ansi
[38;5;81m-e .fs.jsx
```

## Release vs Debug AST

F# & Fable give different AST trees between Release and Debug mode. The plugin was developed with Release mode in mind.
This is a non-issue until you try to compile with `fable watch`.

> When compiling with <c>fable watch</c> or in debug mode, use the release flag

```ansi
[38;5;81m-c Release
```

## Typed arrays

Fable uses the most optimised/performant primitives when compiling to `js` (ie not `ts`). This means integer arrays are
compiled into the Int32Array primitives in `js`.

This becomes an issue when you're passing arrays of integers to libraries like `ApexCharts`.

There are two solutions to the problem, you can either disable typed arrays using a fable flag:

```ansi
[38;5;81m--typedArrays false
```

Or, you can `cast` the integers into a different type:

```fsharp

// VALID:
let data = [|
    box 4
    box 18
    box 43
|]

```
