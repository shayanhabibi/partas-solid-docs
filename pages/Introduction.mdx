# Introduction

[Partas.Solid](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid) is a plugin for [Fable](https://fable.io/), a F# to JS
transpiler.

An opinionated fork of [Lanayx's Oxpecker.Solid](https://github.com/lanayx/Oxpecker), the plugin aggressively transforms
the Fable AST to produce Solid-js compatible JSX. This allows you to have a front end with the performance of Solid-js,
with the F# language and compiler to prop up your development experience.

## Why something else

This might be a *personal* thing, that I alone feel frustrated by, but I do not like that a DSL to write out HTML/JSX,
does not allow you to then create, and use components _WITHIN_ the same DSL.

I greatly appreciate, and understand the motivation to build into function calls, following F# idioms, but it does
not exclude the desire for a seamless, and ubiquitous DSL in reusing components.

**With Partas.Solid, you can create a component library like Shad-cn COMPLETELY within F#, and share it for other users**.

```fsharp
[<Erase>]
type SolidComponent() =
    inherit RegularNode()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        div()
```
