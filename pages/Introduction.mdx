# Introduction

<PartasSolidLink>Partas.Solid</PartasSolidLink> is a plugin for <FableLink>Fable</FableLink>, a F# to JS
transpiler.

If you're not aware of <FableLink>Fable</FableLink>, and/or are new to F#, then I suggest you visit their website first
to see what it's all about! 

An opinionated fork of Lanayx's <OxpeckerSolidLink>Oxpecker.Solid</OxpeckerSolidLink>, the plugin aggressively transforms
the Fable AST to produce Solid-js compatible **JSX**. This allows you to have a front end with the performance of Solid-js,
with the F# language and compiler to prop up your development experience.

# Why Partas.Solid

<PartasSolidLink>Partas.Solid</PartasSolidLink> differs from other front end plugins in F# in its overarching goal:

> To define a DSL that allows building HTML/JSX trees for native, imported, **and** user defined components

## What this means

* You can use native elements like `div` in the Oxpecker DSL
* You can bind and use imported library elements in the Oxpecker DSL
* **You can _define_ a component** and use it **in the Oxpecker DSL**
* User defined components are ***indistinguishable*** from native or library imported components in their usage.
* When creating a UI element, you can inherit the ability to receive children or not, have classes, have event signatures, all by interfacing a single type. No need to overload. No need to define optional signatures. Just go.

The first two points are pretty ubiquitous across Fable frameworks. The rest are unique to Partas.Solid.

For instance, if I wanted to build a component base which was a button but it printed to console whenever it was mounted (as an example of some side effect), defining it doesn't require me to make a static method with optional arguments for all the properties of a button etc. It's as simple as this:

```fsharp title="Making a component in Partas.Solid"
[<Erase>]
type MyButton() =
    inherit button()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.__ =
        onMount(fun() -> console.log "Mounted!")
        button(
            onClick = fun _ -> console.log "Clicked!"
            ).spread props
            // ^--- See the guide for Spread for more details!

[<SolidComponent>]
let Usage () =          // v--- works!    v--- works!
    MyButton(class' = "w-[200px]") { "Click me" } // prints 'Mounted!'
                                    // ^-- prints Clicked! when Clicked.
```


The above is a trivial example, but you get the idea. You can compose flexible components into a library which are compiled and usable just like any JSX component library out there. You can then compose these into F# value functions at a higher level. Increase the speed at which you can refactor components at a massive scale by building the UI from the ground up.

The point is YOU have more flexibility in composition.

### Compiled Output

Partas.Solid produces ***clean readable JSX code*** which provides numerous advantages when it comes to debugging or convincing your team to migrate to F#.

See [Advantages of JSX Output](/compiledoutput).

<div id = "oxpeckerDSL">
### Oxpecker DSL - Computation Expressions
</div>

```fsharp title="Oxpecker DSL"
[<SolidComponent>]
let MyComponent () =
    div(class' = "flex justify-center") {
        button(class' = "bg-primary text-primary") {
            "Button"
        }
    }
```

<OxpeckerSolidLink>Oxpecker</OxpeckerSolidLink> provides a DSL that has several advantages in my view:

1. An error does not propagate into the whole list declaration resulting in brackets of red
2. Distinguishing between children and properties is more intuitive
3. Resembles JSX more closely
4. Makes interop less verbose
5. Subjectively less verbose

But it does come with its own costs associated with:
1. Constructor parameters suggestion/completion for extension setters is lacking (specifically in Rider, this is a known issue that hopefully is corrected in the future)
2. Computation Expressions can potentially burden analysers and slow down compilation in monoliths (but this is yet to be measured)

### Why Fork Oxpecker

I continue to contribute to Oxpecker.Solid. You can [read more on why the fork came about.](/oxpeckerfork)

While this fork moves towards its own opinionated goal, most (if not all) functionality of Oxpecker.Solid is adopted by Partas.Solid.

The larger breadth that Partas.Solid takes leads to more laborious and cumbersome requirements and development of the plugin API surface. But the end result is a more expansive and flexible developer experience.

## Why choose Partas.Solid?

Besides Solid-js being the most performant front end framework?

My goal is to make the most expressive and easy to use framework to produce your front end.

I am actively and extensively developing the plugin to be compatible with a wide variety of libraries, with usage being as native as possible.

You can rest assured that I will support you in your development process to the best of my ability.
