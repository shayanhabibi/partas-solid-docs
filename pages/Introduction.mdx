# Introduction

<PartasSolidLink>Partas.Solid</PartasSolidLink> is a plugin for <FableLink>Fable</FableLink>, a F# to JS
transpiler.

An opinionated fork of Lanayx's <OxpeckerSolidLink>Oxpecker.Solid</OxpeckerSolidLink>, the plugin aggressively transforms
the Fable AST to produce Solid-js compatible JSX. This allows you to have a front end with the performance of Solid-js,
with the F# language and compiler to prop up your development experience.

## Why something else

This might be a *personal* thing, that I alone feel frustrated by, but I do not like that a DSL to write out HTML/JSX,
does not allow you to then create, and use components _WITHIN_ the same DSL.

I greatly appreciate, and understand the motivation to build into function calls, following F# idioms, but it does
not exclude the desire for a seamless, and ubiquitous DSL in reusing components.

**With Partas.Solid, you can create a component library like shad-cn COMPLETELY within F#, and share it for other users**.
