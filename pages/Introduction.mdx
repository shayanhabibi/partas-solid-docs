# Introduction

<PartasSolidLink>Partas.Solid</PartasSolidLink> is a plugin for <FableLink>Fable</FableLink>, a F# to JS
transpiler.

An opinionated fork of Lanayx's <OxpeckerSolidLink>Oxpecker.Solid</OxpeckerSolidLink>, the plugin aggressively transforms
the Fable AST to produce Solid-js compatible JSX. This allows you to have a front end with the performance of Solid-js,
with the F# language and compiler to prop up your development experience.

# Why Partas.Solid

<PartasSolidLink>Partas.Solid</PartasSolidLink> differs from other front end plugins in F# in its overarching goal:

> To define a DSL that allows building HTML/JSX trees for native, imported, **and** user defined components

## What this means

Many front-end frameworks define a DSL that allows you to build a tree of native elements such as **Feliz**

```fsharp title="Feliz DSL"
[<ReactComponent>]
let MyComponent () =
    Html.div [
        prop.className "flex justify-center"
        prop.children [
            Html.button [
                prop.className "bg-primary text-primary"
                prop.text "Button"
            ]
        ]
    ]
```

But it is not possible to then use components in the same DSL. Your components are built into functions or static members. Static members would be the closest you could get to the flexibility of having optional properties/attributes.

You can interop with JS libraries, but the process can be laborious since you have to use various interop functions like mkProperty or createElement.

### Oxpecker Style - Computation Expressions

```fsharp title="Oxpecker DSL"
[<SolidComponent>]
let MyComponent () =
    div(class' = "flex justify-center") {
        button(class' = "bg-primary text-primary") {
            "Button"
        }
    }
```

<OxpeckerSolidLink>Oxpecker</OxpeckerSolidLink> provides a DSL that has several advantages in my view:

1. An error does not propagate into the whole list declaration resulting in brackets of red
2. Distinguishing between children and properties is more intuitive
3. Resembles JSX more closely
4. Makes interop less verbose
5. Subjectively less verbose

But it does come with its own costs associated with:
1. Constructor parameters suggestion/completion for extension setters is lacking (specifically in Rider, this is a known issue that hopefully is corrected in the future)
2. Computation Expressions can potentially burden analysers and slow down compilation in monoliths (but this is yet to be measured)

#### Interop with Oxpecker style

You can define new tags to interop with libraries:

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.SomeLibrary
open Partas.Solid
open Fable.Core
[<Import("SomeComponent", "SomeLibrary")>]
type SomeComponent() =
    interface RegularNode
    [<Erase>] member val someAttribute: string = JS.undefined with get,set
```

Unfortunately, Oxpecker.Solid does not provide the functionality to fulfill the overarching goal above, as you cannot have **user-defined** components that are usable in the same DSL.

This is because Oxpecker.Solid has a divergent opinionated goal, which is to provide a clean, performant, and minimally intrusive plugin transformation to interop with Solid-js.

### Partas.Solid

```fsharp title="Partas expanded Oxpecker DSL"
type CenteredButton() =
    inherit button()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.constructor =
        div(class' = "flex justify-center") { button().spread props }
        
// ...

[<SolidComponent>]
let MyComponent () =
    CenteredButton(class' = "bg-primary text-primary") { "Button" }
```

While this fork moves towards its own opinionated goal, most (if not all) functionality of Oxpecker.Solid is adopted by Partas.Solid.

The larger breadth that Partas.Solid takes leads to more laborious and cumbersome requirements and development of the plugin API surface. But the end result is a more expansive and flexible developer experience.

# Why choose Partas.Solid

Besides Solid-js being the most performant front end framework?

My goal is to make the most expressive and easy to use framework to produce your front end.

I am actively and extensively developing the plugin to be compatible with a wide variety of libraries, with usage being as native as possible.

You can rest assured that I will support you in your development process to the best of my ability.
