# Bindings

See [Partas.Solid.Bindings](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/Partas.Solid.Bindings) for a suite of prebuilt bindings to
popular Solid-js libraries.

# Binding Specification

This is for superbly crafted bindings. Naturally, we will tend for auto generation (because making bindings is dumb waste
of time). But there are those *special* libraries that might want special attention.

A good series of suggestions to follow to make the ecosystem of top notch bindings work well together.

## Naming

The convention of starting all namespaces with `Partas.Solid` is to prevent *over-zealous* transformation by the plugin.
This might change in the future. However, this is only pertinent when it comes to using the rendering of DOM elements by
the plugin.

Feel free to ask that this be removed, I am not fussed, it is mostly an inherited historical trait.

Have a primary access point through an obvious namespace such as `Partas.Solid.Kobalte` rather than `Partas.Solid.Fabalte`
(unless it is not a binding).

## Specs

Recommended to create a `Spec` file which includes constant literals such as paths to the libraries. Place these in a
module 'Spec'. Include a string literal of the version of the binding which is publicly accessible. Feel free to apply
the erasure attribute.

If the file is sparse, then you can include the Enums module in here.

## Enums

For bindings, best practice should be to consolidate them to the Spec or Enums file and under a shadow `Enums` module (ie auto-opened).
This will aid in providing a consistent path to finding enums when there are libraries providing conflicting enumerations
such as `Orientation`.

DO NOT further compartmentalise them behind other modules to avoid extended names. DO name them in full, and THEN create
sub modules with aliased types to the original.

```fsharp
namespace Partas.Solid.Kobalte


[<Erase; AutoOpen>]
module Enums =
    [<StringEnum; RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    type TextFieldInputOrientation =
        | Ltr
        | Rtl
        
    [<RequireQualifiedAccess; Erase>]
    module TextFieldInput =
        type Orientation = TextFieldInputOrientation
    
    [<StringEnum>]
    type PopperOrientation =
        | Start
        | End
        
    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    module Popper =
        type Orientation = PopperOrientation
```

#### Advantages

It takes less cognitive effort to find an enum or ensure you're picking the right one if you just suffix the library
you're using with `.Enums` to dot into all the accessible enumerations. If there are conflicting names, or you
want to provide shorter syntaxes, then you should (with or without QualifiedAccess) put aliases in submodules.

#### Disadvantages

Verbose. Also making bindings sucks.

---

Follow PascalCasing, use `CompiledName` and `CompiledValue` where required.

Use `RequireQualifiedAccess` as much as possible.

You can place further aliases to an enum as static members in the type it is specific too.

## Optional parameters/Objects

Where a bound member has optional parameters taken as an object such as:

```
someMethod ( someparam, options: { someotherparam, someotherotherparam })
```

Try to provide a signature that uses this scheme:

```fsharp
[<ImportMember(path); ParamObject(1)>]
static member someMethod(someparam: 'T, ?someotherparam: 'T, ?someotherotherparam: 'T): 'T = jsNative
[<ImportMember(path)>]
static member someMethod(someparam: 'T): 'T = jsNative
```

The `ParamObject` attribute will collect the options into a pojo. If no optional arguments are filled, then an empty pojo
would be rendered. To prevent this, we provide a signature that doesnt have the optional arguments.

In the case where there are optionals that take pojos (or the option has to be named argument) then you can use some indirection as follows:

```fsharp
[<JS.Pojo>]
type SomeMethodOptions(?someotherparam: 'T, ?someotherotherparam: 'T) =
    member val someotherparam = someotherparam with get,set
    member val someotherotherparam = someotherotherparam with get,set
// ...
[<ImportMember(path)>]
static member someMethod(someparam: 'T, ?options: obj): 'T = jsNative
static member inline someMethod(someparam: 'T, ?someotherparam: 'T, ?someotherotherparam: 'T): 'T =
    TYPE.someMethod(someparam, options = SomeMethodOptions(?someotherparam = someotherparam, ?someotherotherparam = someotherotherparam))
```

Essentially, it would be nice to flatten the optional arguments into the signature where possible - and/or appropriate -
to prevent the user having to build the options object themselves.
