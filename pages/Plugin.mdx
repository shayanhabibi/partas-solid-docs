# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm preparing for release, the docs are under renovation.

This section describes the salient elements of the Plugin to help onboard anyone who wishes to develop on it, or utilise similar patterns.

# Architecture

```ansi title="File Structure"
Partas.Solid.FablePlugin
|-- Types.fs
|-- Utils.fs
|-- Spec.fs
|__ Plugin.fs
```

The plugin is divided into compartments

---

## Types

```ansi title="File Structure" "Types.fs"
Partas.Solid.FablePlugin
|-- Types.fs
|-- Utils.fs
|-- Spec.fs
|__ Plugin.fs
```

Contains DUs, types, and functions relating to those types.

---
## Utils

```ansi title="File Structure" "Utils.fs"
Partas.Solid.FablePlugin
├⎯ Types.fs
├⎯ Utils.fs
├⎯ Spec.fs
⎣⎯ Plugin.fs
```

Contains utilities that are frequently used to simplify pattern recognition such as:

```fsharp
let (|StartsWith|_|) (value: string) = function
    | (s: string) when s.StartsWith(value) -> Some()
    | _ -> None
```

These utilities should be based on primitives rather than structures defined in `Types.fs`.

The only reason it is compiled after `Types.fs` is to allow us to utilise `PluginContext` (which is defined in `Types.fs`) if required.

---

## Spec

```ansi title="File Structure" "Spec.fs"
Partas.Solid.FablePlugin
|-- Types.fs
|-- Utils.fs
|-- Spec.fs
|__ Plugin.fs
```
