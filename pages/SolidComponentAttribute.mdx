# SolidComponentAttribute

## Overview

Apply this to bindings you are compiling into tag/element bindings:

```fsharp
[<SolidComponent>]
let Button (label: string) =
    button(class' = "btn") { label }
```

## Requirements

The Attribute is only required when transformation of the body/content is required for elements in the DSL.

```fsharp title="Can compose bindings without the SolidComponentAttribute"
[<SolidComponent>]
let WrapDiv (btn: button) =
    div() { btn }

let Render () =
    "Button"
    |> Button
    |> WrapDiv
```

## Gotchas

Solid-js works under the modus operandi 'everything is a function'. This means you can use your bindings as components **if they are functions**.

Ie. Ensure your component has a unit parameter/argument if you want to use it as a component.

## How does it work

This attribute recursively transforms the body of a member/function.
It recursively searches the AST for tags, collects these tags into Elements, and compiles them as a Fable.Core call to JSX.create.

<div class="px-8 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
    There are a few other optimisations and tricks that the plugin does with the AST, such as removing CE calls in lists etc to prevent obscuring Solid-JSs reactivity system. This was before Fable included these optimisations internally.
</div>

## When else to use it

A common case is when you are referring to a Tag element value when constructing a record or tuple to pass or store for the UI to access (such as an icon).

Without being in a scope accessible by the plugin (a binding or member with a SolidComponent or SolidTypeComponent attribute) the `!@` operator would not work.

However, if your icon/tag/element was a function binding (as opposed to a TypeComponent binding) then this wouldn't be an issue, and you can refer to the icon/tag/element directly.

```fsharp
[<Erase>]
type LucideActivity() =
    inherit Lucide.Activity()
    [<SolidTypeComponent>]
    member props.__ =
        Lucide.Activity()

[<SolidComponent>]
let MyIcon () =
    Lucide.Activity()

// ...
// Notice this is not in a Plugin scope
for item in titles do
    match item with
    | "Sports" -> // v---- This won't work
        item, Some !@LucideActivity
        // This would work
        item, Some MyIcon

[<SolidComponent>] // <-- Plugin Scope
let makeItems =
    for item in titles do
        match item with
        | "Sports" -> // v--- Works
            item, Some !@LucideActivity
```

## Signatures

```fsharp
type SolidComponentAttribute(flag: int)
new()
new(compileOptions: ComponentFlag)
```

```fsharp
type ComponentFlag =
    /// Default transformations.
    | Default = 0b0000
    /// Prints the AST tree before transformation. Please supply a minimal
    /// example with this flag set when submitting issues.
    | DebugMode = 0b0001
    /// SolidComponents optimise Pojo constructors so that
    /// setter members which are not in the primary constructor that
    /// are used when building the pojo, are compiled into the object
    /// initialiser in JS instead of being deferred
    | SkipPojoOptimisation = 0b0010
    /// Noisy. Prints any expressions that are disposed of in transformation.
    | PrintDisposals = 0b0100
    /// SolidComponents optimise out computation expressions, particularly of
    /// lists etc. In Fable 5, this should be handled by the compiler.
    | SkipCEOptimisation = 0b1000
```

```fsharp
[<SolidComponent(
    ComponentFlag.DebugMode 
    ||| ComponentFlag.SkipPojoOptimisation)>]
let Binding () = // ...
```
