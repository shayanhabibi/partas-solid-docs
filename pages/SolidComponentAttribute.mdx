# SolidComponentAttribute

## Overview

Apply this to bindings you are compiling into tag bindings:

```fsharp
[<SolidComponent>]
let Button (label: string) =
    button(class' = "btn") { label }
```

## Requirements

The Attribute is only required when transformation of the body/content is required for elements in the DSL.

```fsharp title="Can compose bindings without the SolidComponentAttribute"
[<SolidComponent>]
let WrapDiv (btn: button) =
    div() { btn }

let Render () =
    "Button"
    |> Button
    |> WrapDiv
```

## Gotchas

Solid-js works under the modus operandi 'everything is a function'. This means you can use your bindings as components **if they are functions**.

Ie. Ensure your component has a unit parameter/argument if you want to use it as a component.

## How does it work

This attribute recursively transforms the body of a member/function.
It recursively searches the AST for tags, collects these tags into Elements, and compiles them as a Fable.Core call to JSX.create.
