# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm preparing for release, the docs are under renovation.

# Partas.Solid.Kobalte

## Kobalte Bindings

See [the docs]() for usage.

~~As of June, the only components that have not been bound as it currently stands are the color related components (as making a sound type interface is key).~~ (that lasted all of one day)

## Differences

The polymorphism of Kobalte via `as` is provided via the extension method `.as'`. This takes either a `TagValue`, or a constructed component tag.

The advantage of the latter, is that you will get the type guarantees from setting properties in the constructor of the component tag rather than using `.attr` extension chains for attributes
of the polymorphed type that are not provided in the Kobalte component.

> Each component implements its `Root` as the component name, and then the sub-components via the component name qualified.
> Eg: `Combobox()` & `Combobox.Input()`

Install via femto or manually with:

```
npm install @kobalte/core

# Example Component

```fsharp title="Building a tooltip with Kobalte headless components"
[<Erase>]
type TooltipTrigger() =
    inherit Tooltip.Trigger()
    [<SolidTypeComponentAttribute>]
    member props.constructor = Tooltip.Trigger().spread props

[<Erase>]
type Tooltip() =
    inherit Kobalte.Tooltip()
    [<SolidTypeComponentAttribute>]
    member props.constructor = Kobalte.Tooltip(gutter = 4).spread props

[<Erase>]
type TooltipContent() =
    inherit Tooltip.Content()
    [<SolidTypeComponentAttribute>]
    member props.constructor =
        Tooltip.Portal() {
            Tooltip.Content(
                class' =
                    Lib.cn [|
                        "z-50 origin-[var(--kb-popover-content-transform-origin)]
                        overflow-hidden rounded-md border bg-popover px-3 py-1.5
                        text-sm text-popover-foreground shadow-md animate-in fade-in-0 zoom-in-95"
                        props.class'
                    |]
                ).spread props
        }
```

# Contexts

While not mentioned in the Kobalte docs, most of the components have accessible Contexts exposed from their root components. This is useful in things like dialogs etc.

At this current time, I've only implemented the Contexts for the components to which I would find it helpful.

# ColorMode

Another unmentioned utility in Kobalte is the `ColorModeProvider` (*which is poorly named in my opinion; more accurately a ThemeModeProvider*) which handles theme and local theme storage etc.

It provides a reactive signal utility which does the connecting boiler plate for you, and other helpful options.

See [the binding]() file for details.
