# Partas.Solid.Lucide

## Lucide Bindings

See [the docs]() for usage.

## Usage

All the normal icons are accessible as components via the `Partas.Solid.Lucide` namespace.

If you want to use the LucideLab icons, you must use the `Icon` component:

```fsharp
open Partas.Solid.Lucide

Check() // ... Normal icon

// v--- Icon Component for LucideLab icons
Icon(iconNode = LucideLab.yinYang) // ... Lucide lab icon
```

This is autogenerated (*from the react library*) using a generator I made for Feliz. The solid library was just a bit more
janky in organisation, and the names were the same anyway.
