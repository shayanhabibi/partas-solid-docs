# Debugging & Reporting Issues

If something doesn't seem to be going right, please use the `DebugMode` flag in combination with the actual `jsx` output and report an issue so that it can be addressed.

```fsharp title="Using the DebugFlag"
[<SolidComponent(ComponentFlag.DebugMode)>]
// ...

[<SolidTypeComponent(ComponentFlag.DebugMode)>]
// ...
```

### DebugMode

The `DebugMode` flag will cause the AST of the component in question to be printed. This in combination with the input, and the actual `jsx` output will allow any issue to be addressed.

# Common Issues

The most frequent issues that I run into are:
1. Forgetting to use a namespace that starts with Partas.Solid
    - The original motivation for this was to prevent over zealous transformations
2. Forgetting to `yield` an anonymous function in a computation

```fsharp "yield"
For(each = [| "1"; "2" |]) {
    yield fun item index -> // ...
}
```

3. Forgetting to turn off typedArrays
