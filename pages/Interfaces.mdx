# Interfaces

Listed below are the definition, purpose and usage of the predefined Interfaces for Components and Elements.

### HtmlElement

Base interface for all Elements/Components. No attached properties associated.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type HtmlElement = interface end
```

### HtmlTag

Base interface or any element/component which inherits the core DOM attributes. Does not include `children`.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type HtmlTag =
    inherit HTMLAttributes
    inherit HtmlElement
```

### HtmlContainer

Base interface which provides the `children` attribute and allows the builder computation expression for the element.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type HtmlContainer = inherit HtmlElement
```

### RegularNode

Generic interface for components that can have children and inherit the core DOM attributes.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type RegularNode =
    inherit HtmlTag
    inherit HtmlContainer
```

### VoidNode

Generic interface for components that inherit the core DOM attributes but cannot have children.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type VoidNode =
    inherit HtmlTag
```

### Fragment Node

Special interface that shouldn't be used outside of the internal library.

```fsharp
[<AllowNullLiteral; Interface>]
type FragmentNode =
    inherit HtmlContainer
```

## IChildLambdaProvider implementations

> This is primarily for binding libraries

Special interfaces which allow state to be passed to children via a lambda like the `For` or `Index` standard components.

```fsharp
For(each = [| 1;2;3 |]) {
    yield fun item idx -> // make sure to `yield` the lambda
        div() { item.ToString() }
}
```

The general ChildLambda interfaces will accept any derivative of HtmlElement, while the Strict interfaces accept any derivative of the type passed to the type signature at the end.

```fsharp
// General providers
type ChildLambdaProvider<'Param1> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider2<'Param1, 'Param2> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider3<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProvider4<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Param4> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
// Strict providers
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict<'Param1, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict2<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict3<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
type ChildLambdaProviderStrict4<'Param1, 'Param2, 'Param3, 'Param4, 'Children> = inherit IChildLambdaProvider
```

You could recreate the For and Index elements with these primitive interfaces:

```fsharp
[<Import("For","solid-js")>]
type For()<'T> =
    interface ChildLambdaProvider2<'T, Accessor<int>>
    [<Erase>]
    member val each: 'T seq = JS.undefined with get,set
```
